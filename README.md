# Continuous-Variable-Transmission---Hydraulic
CVT assembly that relies on Hydraulic Rectification. Similar design to that of a CVT that incorporates a Variable displacement pump.

a Continuous Variable Transmission that utilised a variable-displacement pump, operating on a 3-phase oscillating lever-arm system rather than the traditional rotating disk design. 
The oscillating fluid dynamics resulting from the pump were then rectified into a direct current that was fed through a Savonius turbine, returning the alternating fluid current to direct, torque-altered rotational motion.
